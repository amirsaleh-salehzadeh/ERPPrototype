# PROMETHEUS ALERT RULES CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# This file defines alerting rules for the ERP system monitoring.
# Rules are evaluated by Prometheus and trigger alerts when conditions are met.
# Alerts are then sent to Alertmanager for processing and notification.
